    <!-- This is a base path which is often set to "/" . -->
    <!-- All the routing and downloaded files are relative to this root. -->
    <!-- This generates a route such as this: localhost:4200 . -->
    <!-- Using the root base during development is ok, but when the application is deployed it makes no sense. -->
    <!-- 
      If we need to deploy production application inside of subfolder such as www.mySite.com/APM/ we would need to change 
      base href to <base href="/APM/" .
      We could do that manually in here, but the better solution would be to use Angular CLI.
      When deploying app to production you could use ng build --base-href /APM/
